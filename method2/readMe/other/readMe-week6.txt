xplicitcrossval-WEEK6
Description-

Train everything together and choose the mode among the results

All electrodes, threshold, and classes have been put in a single matrix.
Everything is trained together categorically.
MAIN AIM WAS to USE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION TECHNIQUES OVER HERE.


"Tried some other things such as
- No normalisation
- include electrode as features
 The above can be easily coded by modifying main and explicitcrossval":



codes-
"explicitcrossval_time" for prediction
"main" for dataset formation
cell form dataset implies it is explicitcrossval_time

"explicitcrossval_freq" is a variation for raw spectrogram analysis

results-
week6 excel sheet


conclusion-
simple classification of the entire histogram
Take care of dataset formation
